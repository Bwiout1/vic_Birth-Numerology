             "With a one Life Path, you’re an original forward thinker. This is great when it comes to your career and leading the world to a better future, but not everyone is going to be able to put up with your domineering spirit.\r\n\r\nAs a result of their innovative spirit, someone with a one Life Path needs a partner that’s willing to stand back and let them explore all the things life has to offer. This can often mean taking a back seat while the One goes off to save the world in their own special way.\r\n\r\nBut a One has redeeming qualities too. With all that innovation a life with them will never be boring. As long as the One and their partner share a common goal and similar values this can be a very fortuitous match for someone that’s looking to break the relationship mold.",
             "People with a Two Life Path are all about other people. They are built for relationships and often put others first at their own expense. This can be a nice quality for someone looking for a faithful and loving partner. But it can also mean that the Two gets the raw end of the deal.\r\n\r\nAnd because a Two will never purposefully want to start a fight, they’ll suffer in silence until they just can’t anymore. This can lead to a few emotionally unstable moments in their relationships.\r\n\r\nA Two’s best match is someone who will take the time to listen to them, even when they aren’t entirely ready to share their feelings. Two’s need as much compassion as they give others in order to thrive in a romantic relationship. If their partner is willing to go the extra mile for them the Two will more than return the favor.",
             "People with a Three Life Path are diehard romantics. They are incredibly creative and love coming up with novel ways of showing their partner how much they care. \r\n\r\nBut Threes are also very social. They love the attention they get from other people. This can mean that they flirt and bend the truth just to boost their own ego. So, although a Three isn’t likely to cheat on their partner outright, they can make their partner quite jealous in certain situations.\r\n\r\nAs long as the Three keeps using their creativity to show their partner they care instead of looking for attention from others they can really get along with almost everyone. But they will need their partner’s undivided attention and affection from time to time to be truly happy. If they aren’t feeling loved and wanted they will go look for attention from someone else.",
            "Fours are extremely methodical and their relationships are no different. These are the people that have a life plan all set out and actually follow through on it. \r\n\r\nWhen a Four decides that it’s time to settle down they’ll focus all their energy on finding the perfect partner. But their need for stability and forward planning can make romance a bit problematic.\r\n\r\nA Four won’t fall in love with just anyone and they expect their partner to fit into their plans perfectly. Unfortunately, this means that they tend to either project their own expectations onto their partner, or they just go through life alone because nobody fits into their plan. For a Four to be truly happy they need someone who can coax them to embrace the uncertainties of life, while at the same time understanding the Four’s need for stability.",
             "Someone with a Five Life Path has an adventurous spirit. They love exploring everything the world has to offer – including relationships. Fives love having a good time.\r\n\r\nThis is very exciting and fun when things are going well in a relationship. But when a relationship hits a rough spot the Five is likely to go off and try to recreate the same fun with someone else instead of fixing the problem.\r\n\r\nThat’s why Fives find it so difficult to settle down with a single partner. They need someone who can help them deal with problems and then have more fun, instead of someone who’s going to hold a grudge. Their partner will have to be emotionally mature enough to guide the Five through the tough spots and then drop it – a Five hates a gloomy atmosphere that drags on for days. But when a Five meets this mature and fun person they’ll be overjoyed to have someone to share their adventures with.",
             "Sixes are creatures of comfort. They strive to make their lives as comfortable as possible. And while they can become a bit too laid back at times, they do understand the value of effort.\r\n\r\nThis can make them expect a lot from their partner. Sixes often go the extra mile for the person they are with. If their person doesn’t reciprocate with the same level of affection and understanding the Six can become resentful.\r\n\r\nThis isn’t necessarily a problem if the Six has learned to communicate their feelings openly and calmly. But if they are in a fiery relationship it can cause quite a stir when they feel their needs aren’t met. If their needs are met the Six will be the epitome of the perfect life partner as they strive to create their own slice of heaven on earth to share with their one true love.",
             "Sevens are notoriously shy. They tend to think – a lot; about everything. And because they’re constantly stuck with their nose in a book most Sevens are quite awkward too. \r\n\r\nThe plus side of this is that they know a LOT. The downside is that the Seven feels like they know too much to be able to make anything happen. Plus they’re content to exercise their minds rather than their bodies. They can sit for hours just dreaming away time.\r\n\r\nIt’s easy for a Seven to forget about the world around them and if they aren’t reminded of someone’s presence and needs they do tend to get a little self-involved. Generally speaking, a Seven is one of the more placid numbers though – content to just be in the comfort of familiar surroundings.",
             "The Eight is an interesting person. On the surface, they appear calm and collected. But in their minds, they are constantly busy absorbing information and sorting it into patterns. They are some of the most observant people on the planet and can get a bit too involved with unnecessary details at times.\r\n\r\nThey make very aware partners though and will pick up on the needs of their loved one easily – often before the person has had a chance to figure out what they needed. On the other hand, the Eight can become meddlesome and create problems where there weren’t any to begin with.\r\n\r\nFor an Eight to be truly happy they need someone who can help them stay balanced and grounded. When the Eight has a solid goal in place there is very little that will be able to stop them from reaching their destination.",
            "Nines are extremely placid. They seem to float through life on cloud nine. Excuse the cliché, but there is no better way to describe the aura the Nine exudes. They immediately draw the attention of anyone who values stability and ease.\r\n\r\nBut this is just their exterior. On the inside, the Nine has doubts and fears just like anyone else. Except these Nines that walk around seemingly conjuring opportunity out of thin air have a trick up their sleeve. They are highly intuitive. So it’s not so much that they conjure the opportunities. Instead, they just see them looming on the horizon long before anyone else does.\r\n\r\nThis can make them a bit difficult to live with because they’ll point out synchronicities long before others catch on. But overall they make very caring and considerate partners.",
            "A match between two Ones can be formidable. If the two of you can combine your positive traits you can literally take over the world!\r\n\r\nBut that’s going to be difficult seeing as both of you want to be the boss. If you don’t watch out, things can get very heated very quickly. And once they do neither of you will want to back down…\r\n\r\nGenerally, this isn’t the best match, but as far as relationships go you’ll be able to learn a lot from each other. You have plenty in common and you’ll be able to respect each other for your strengths. But when it comes to accepting each other’s flaws, that’s going to be your biggest challenge!\r\n\r\nSo while this isn’t a match made in heaven, there is major potential for personal growth and expansion with this union – making it worth the effort if you choose to stick it out.",
             "As a One, you can be quite dominant and self-involved. You’ll love the fact that the Two is always there for you, but you might forget to be there for them too. This can lead to deep-seated resentment. Because unfortunately, your Two partner doesn’t have the guts to stand up for themselves like you do – something you’re going to HAVE to remember and accept to make this relationship work.\r\n\r\nYour Two partner is going to need you to come down off your pedestal and check in on them. If you can’t do that the kindest thing you can do is let them go. Because your Two will go to the ends of the earth for you, even if that means sacrificing themselves in the process.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you can set your ego aside and allow your soft side to shine through on a regular basis you could be their “knight in shining armor”.",
             "The Three is an enigmatic creature that draws you in with their next-level social skills and creativity. As a One, you love spending time with a Three. It feels like they really understand you – and they probably do.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes it can feel as though the Three understands everyone, and that can make you jealous – especially if the Three uses one of your less than perfect moments against you.\r\n\r\nWhile Threes are great in social situations they can blur the line between what’s appropriate to share and what isn’t. This can become problematic for you because as a One you like to save face around others. You’re also going to have to accept that the Three will have lots of friends, and they may cross your boundaries with some of those friends. But if you can explain your ego needs to your Three and trust that they value you as much as you value them the two of you can build a very successful life together.",
             "Your Four partner is a stable force in your life. In fact, their ability to buckle down and get things done is what drew you to them in the first place. You look up to their determination and ability to follow through.\r\n\r\nBut some Fours can be super boring. Sorry to say, but as a One, you have incredible hopes and dreams and sometimes the Four just won’t understand that. They love doing everything by the book. And that can make them a bit of a naysayer when you’re trying to push the limits and create something new in the world.\r\n\r\nThat being said, once you can prove to your Four that you mean business their ability to stick things out will definitely rub off on you. If this relationship makes it through the first few years you two will be inseparable for life. But even if it doesn’t the Four can still teach you how to get back up and keep on trying to make your dreams a reality -  and with their help, you’re very likely to succeed in those efforts.",
             "Wow! That Five in your life right now is lighting fires in corners of your soul you didn’t even know existed! This is probably the most passion you’ve felt in a long time dear One.\r\n\r\nBut those warm, comforting fires can start burning your house down very quickly if you aren’t careful. Your Five partner doesn’t care much about responsibility – they’re a lot more likely to convince you to go out with them and have a good time instead of staying in and working late. This is what makes this relationship so much fun! But on the practical side, it’s also likely to keep you from reaching your life goals.\r\n\r\nIf you’re ambitious, which you probably are, it’s best to keep this relationship short and sweet – like a weekend getaway to an exotic destination. It’s awesome to visit, but would you really like to live in a hut on a beach your entire life without fully satisfying our need to be a leader in the world..? Then again, if the hut is calling your name this could be an interesting life experience for you ;)",
             "An amiable Six has caught your attention. Their ability to create an aura of peace around them is spellbinding. You can’t help but to imagine amazing things when they’re around. But the question is, do you have the ability to make those imaginings real for yourself?\r\n\r\nA Six will do everything in their power to keep you comfortable, but they do draw the line at living your life for you. If you haven’t mastered the art of sticking to a plan until it becomes a reality your Six is going to get a bit frustrated with you. They have their own lives to live so they’re going to put pressure on you to live your own.\r\n\r\nInstead of dreaming the days away, focus on your own goals. A six loves seeing the people around them succeed. If you can show your appreciation for the comfort they bring to your life by putting effort into your dreams and sharing the results with them they will stick by your side forever.",
             "You love the strong silent type and that’s exactly what a Seven is. They have this insane ability to think of everything in advance and can set up a fail-safe plan in the blink of an eye.\r\n\r\nBut the problem is that neither of you has a knack for following through on plans. On the one hand, you can come up with some pretty amazing ideas. And your Seven can set out goals step by step. But, unless one of you have mastered the art of sticking to a plan, those plans end up going to waste more often than not.\r\n\r\nYou need to train yourself to stay focused on the important things and bring your Seven back to the present moment. Then the two of you can make quite a formidable team with just the right amount of brawn and brains.",
             "It’s amazing how the two of you can talk for hours about the way the world works, and how much better it could work. You both understand that there’s usually more to a situation than meets the eye. But while you like to think of the solutions to one or two problems, the Eight loves to keep finding the problems.\r\n\r\nEven while you’re just imagining a scenario where certain real-world rules don’t apply the Eight will swoop in and point out that you’re missing the rules you’re neglecting. This can stifle your creativity and make you feel a bit depressed at times.\r\n\r\nBut if you can learn to balance your dreams with some practical applications the Eight will soon learn that some rules were meant to be broken. And once they can accept this the two of you stand a very good chance of sticking together.",
             "The Nine has lured you into a mysterious spell. They seem to hold the key to your dreams. With their silver tongue and insanely accurate intuition, they have lured you into believing that anything is possible. \r\n\r\nBut you’ll soon realize that the Nine doesn’t always walk their talk. In fact, they talk a very big game, but unless they catch their big break none of it is likely to materialize. This can become a hindrance to you while you work your way towards your own dreams. You aren’t the type for situationships.\r\n\r\nIf your Nine has the means they require to make their dreams a reality this is a very good relationship for you to be in. They’ll help inspire you to keep working towards your goals. But if your Nine is just tagging along they may be weighing you down more than anything else.",
            "As a Two you are very compassionate and you love people to the end of the earth. Unfortunately, your One partner is probably their own biggest fan already. \r\n\r\nTheir personal power and effortless magnetism is what swept you off your feet. But if you find those qualities even the slightest bit intimidating you’re in for a rough ride.\r\n\r\nUnless you voice your needs the One in your life isn’t even going to notice if you’re working yourself to the bone to keep them happy. And most Ones aren’t going to go the extra mile to make you happy – it’s just not in their nature to run after people in that respect.\r\n\r\nIf you really want this to work you’re going to have to muster up the courage to stand up for yourself. You need to set clear emotional boundaries with a One and approach them in a cool and collected way each and every time you feel like they’re taking advantage of your good nature.",
             "Two Twos have a very unique gift. You’re both compassionate and understanding. There’s probably nothing you don’t know about your partner. Not to mention the care and devotion the two of you share for each other.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is that you’re both very emotional too. So if one of you is upset, both of you are going to be upset. This can make emotional growth in the relationship a bit difficult - Unless one of you fulfills the mature role in a situation of course. But who’s going to be the one to step up and take the lead to find practical solutions?\r\n\r\nIf the two of you can sit down and have a chat to figure out who can be the adult in different situations you’ll see a balanced and effortless relationship blossom. But if both of you are still figuring out how to deal with a certain situation life can turn into a melodrama very quickly.",
             "As a Two you love and admire the Three’s ability to get along with others. But you also value balance and fairness, and the Three doesn’t always play by the same rules.\r\n\r\nA Three is likely to do whatever it takes to get attention, which is fine in your relationship. But when other people start getting involved it’s very easy for them to use your relationship as a tool instead of honoring your privacy. That means that they’ll tell just about anyone anything, even if you expressly asked them to keep it private.\r\n\r\nTo make your relationship with a Three work you’re going to have to turn up your compassion and tone down your emotions to reach a happy balance between your private and social lives. The Three isn’t going to stand for a temper tantrum - even though they can throw quite a tantrum themselves if they feel like things aren’t going their way.",
             "Your Four partner is the light of your life. You love the fact that they value their time and put in so much effort. The two of you have probably discussed your ideal futures in great detail.\r\n\r\nBut it isn’t just you, the Four does spend a great deal of time working to make their ideal future a reality. And yes, when they get into that zone they are probably going to forget about your emotional needs for a while - which is entirely unintentional because in their mind they are building the future for both of you.\r\n\r\nLuckily you form a big part of the Four’s future. So, if you can get their attention for five minutes to explain your needs in a rational way the Four will adjust their vision to include exactly what you need. But if you approach them like a needy child they’ll write off your requests in favor of being the mature adult every time.",
             "You have mixed feelings about the Five in your life. On the one hand, you’re extremely attracted to their ability to let their hair down and have a good time, but on the other hand, you’re struggling to figure out how they actually survive.\r\n\r\nAs a Two you strive to maintain balance. You only play hard when you’ve worked hard. But it seems as though the Five never really works. They just kind of float through life on the winds of change and somehow make it through without a scratch.\r\n\r\nThis instability can either make or break your relationship. If you thrive on exploring new things and you can manage to work with the adventurous spirit of the Five, this can be a very fun relationship. On the other hand, if you crave more stability in your life right now this relationship probably isn’t going to last very long.",
            "A Six is a very nice person to be around and you really appreciate nice people. From the moment the two of you met you have been finding comfort in each other – the basis of a very warm friendship. They make you feel warm and appreciated for the balance and harmony you bring to their life.\r\n\r\nBut this relationship can stay in the friend zone if neither of you steps up to make the first move. You’re both a bit shy and neither of you will want to ruin what you already have. \r\n\r\nBut once you take the plunge it’s going to be fireworks, so be prepared. This one is a keeper. As long as you two remember to keep communicating openly and not let things fester or taper off you are a very good match indeed.",
             "You probably met your Seven at some social event standing off in a corner making quirky comments about the crowd. You admire the way they can read people and predict what’s about to happen next just by taking a quick glance at a crowd.\r\n\r\nBut soon you’ll notice that the Seven might be able to read people well, but they don’t necessarily like them all that much. Most Sevens tend to develop a deep disdain for the human race and this can make them a little grumpy. You, on the other hand, love to spend time dealing with people and solving problems.\r\n\r\nIf you can learn to balance your time between helping others and spending quality time with your Seven the Seven can help you solve some of the conundrums you’re prone to face in life. Unfortunately, that might take up quite a bit of your time, so make sure it’s worth it for you.",
             "How does the Eight do it? They’re always so poised and ready. You keep stumbling over your words like a blubbering idiot, but the Eight has an answer for everything. On the one hand, you love that about them, but on the other, it can become a bit tiresome. \r\n\r\nIf only the Eight didn’t have an answer for EVERYTHING. If only they’d trust you to think of everything by yourself just once… Or maybe you should just learn to do what you wanted to do anyway. The Eight is a natural perfectionist and if you take something to them they are going to look at it critically.\r\n\r\nAs long as you don’t take their comments personally you’ll find that they’re often full of really good advice. But you’re going to make it clear to them that you are capable of handling your own affairs, otherwise they will start to run your life for you.",
            "The Nine that’s caught your eye knows just what to do to make you feel appreciated. That goes a long way for you  -because very few people take the time to notice how much effort you put into every little thing you do.\r\n\r\nBut the Nine has a way of making fun of the amount of effort you spend on some things that really puts you off your game. You can be a little insecure and as a result, you tend to take every nudge at your insecurities as outright criticism. The Nine likes being playful. And they will poke at your soft spots every once in a while.\r\n\r\nThe good thing about a Nine is that they’ll understand why you feel the way you do when they make a joke about something you take seriously. That won’t necessarily stop them from cracking on though.",
             "The first time you lay eyes on the One you were spellbound. Their charisma drew you in like a magnet. You know the One is going places and you’re happy to follow along.\r\n\r\nThe One loves it when you stroke their ego and it’ll help them find the courage to pursue their dreams. But be careful, they can become very possessive – especially if you’re the type of Three that loves complimenting everyone. It’s very easy for your One partner to see other people as a threat.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the two of you can build an amazing life together if you put your minds together. The one is an incredible leader and pioneer while you are insanely creative. So if you’re looking to be the next power-couple you’ve definitely met your match!",
             "As a Three, you love spending time with people. You feed of social energies and your ability to connect with people on a deeper level is what drew the Two to you in the first place.\r\n\r\nBut Two’s are emotional creatures with a very deep understanding of what’s right and wrong. On the other hand, you know you’ve done some morally questionable things in the past… So the question here is, will you be able to clean up your act and stay on the straight and narrow? Or are you going to be hiding things from your Two?\r\n\r\nIf you aren’t sure whether you’re ready to confess your sins it’s probably best to let the Two go. They are extremely loyal and value honesty above everything. If you think you’re going to hurt them in the long run you probably are, so letting them go now is the least selfish thing you can do.",
             "Two Threes can have a lot of fun together, but you are going to have to keep yourselves in check. Both of you are prone to talking about everything that’s going on in your lives, and even embellishing the truth to make a good story… But if your stories don’t match you’re going to end up in some uncomfortable social situations.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it could get to a point where you start losing friends as the two of you compete for attention in social settings. Then again, if you’ve matured beyond the point of desperately needing social acceptance you can be extremely creative together.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it boils down to how much you two have already grown. Your fellow Three can be the best thing that ever happened to you, or they can turn around and stab you in the back out of revenge. Only you’ll be able to tell how this one is going to play out.",
             "In your mind, Fours are generally boring stiffs that are all work and no play. But for some reason you find yourself drawn to the Four that’s currently on your mind… Which brings up the question; why are you so drawn to this particular person right now?\r\n\r\nIt could be that you’re craving some stability in your life. Maybe something has happened recently that’s upset you and now you’re thinking of changing your creative ways to become more of a stick in the mud yourself.\r\n\r\nWhat you have to ask yourself is whether you’re ready to take on responsibilities. Because the Four is going to expect you to be responsible. Or is this just a short phase that’s going to pass as soon as your social wounds have healed? Is it really time for you to grow up and become serious about life?",
            "As a Three, you enjoy meeting up with people and having a good time. Great thing is that this is exactly what Fives love doing too! And the two of you are probably getting along like a house on fire in that respect.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, you do run the risk of having too much fun in this relationship. Both of you are okay with the idea of dropping your responsibilities and having a good time instead. But sooner or later this is bound to catch up with you.\r\n\r\nIt’s very important for you to focus at least some of your energy on being the responsible one in this relationship - Because the Five is going to find it very hard to resist the temptation of turning every day into a grand adventure. If you can manage to avoid bankruptcy this will be one of the best relationships of your life though!",
             "You’re enthralled by the level of comfort and security the Six in your life brings with them. They seem to have it all; they embody everything you ever wanted.\r\n\r\nBut the Six worked very hard to get where they are today. It took a lot of dedication and a fair amount of planning to achieve the success they enjoy. As a three you value creativity more than grit, and the Six’s need to stay focused can make you feel stifled.\r\n\r\nIn order to make the most of this relationship, you’re going to need to start seeing the value in taking responsibility. Learning the art of delayed gratification can help you reach more of your own goals and will show your Six partner that you mean business. And in the process, you’ll learn to value the effort your partner puts into making your life together as comfortable as possible.",
             "Who is this mysterious stranger and what are they hiding? And why is it that when you started talking to them you couldn’t help but cling to every word?\r\n\r\nThe Seven might be a very interesting character full of fun facts and cool ideas. But they’re really a straightforward person. And you can find this a bit disappointing. As a Three, you like getting to know people. But there’s going to come a time when the Seven is done sharing. And if you push too hard they’re going to snap.\r\n\r\nIf you want this Seven to stick by your side you’re going to need to learn boundaries. The safer the Seven feels the more they’ll share. But that means you’re going to have to share some of your deeper secrets too. Are you ready for something that serious?",
             "The Eight has this incredible way of capturing the meaning of beauty so perfectly. They understand that the forest has magic and that there is usually a deeper meaning to life. But boy can they carry on about the deeper meaning of things.\r\n\r\nYou’ll be off exploring a beautiful meadow and come across one empty can and suddenly global warming is the topic of the day. The Eight’s inability to let things go can drive you over the edge at times. But this does give you a rare opportunity to create some magic of your own. The Eight is going to notice every small little detail of effort you put in.\r\n\r\nAnd as long as you can keep them enthralled with the magic you see and create in the world they won’t be drawn to the dark side. Who knows, you might even find their dark and twisted side inspiring.",
            "The Nine is everything you want and need in a partner. They’re confident and understanding enough to keep you in line without making you feel patronized. They’re great to have by your side at a party as they wow everyone with their charm and grace. Really, there isn’t much wrong with your relationship.\r\n\r\nBut that can be a problem in itself. You love a challenge. One of your favorite things to do is solve a relationship problem with a big romantic gesture. But there are no problems – and you find that kind of boring if you’re being honest.\r\n\r\nThe chances that you find someone as good for you as the Nine is very scarce, so maybe it’s time to settle down and start working on big romantic gestures of the good kind… It might be scary for you to think this way, but the two of you get along very well!",
             "As a Four, you enjoy knowing what’s coming next. You enjoy planning ahead and meeting goals. You thrive on stability and structure… But your One partner is exactly the opposite. Instead of pushing through tough times, they think of ways to make life easier.\r\n\r\nThe question is, can you accept this? Can you put your need for stability aside and embrace the One’s unique way of doing things? If you can they can make life a lot easier for you. But if you are determined to do things the same way you always have the two of you are going to run into some trouble.\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, your One partner is going to admire your ability to get things done. So if the two of you can reach a balance between change and stability you’re more than likely to make a very good match.",
             "As a Four, you can get lost in your work very quickly. You feel the urge to create stability in your life and your Two partner can really help you achieve that goal. They’ll help you stay balanced and even feed you when you decide to work through the night four nights in a row…\r\n\r\nBut there will come a point where you are going to have to give back to your Two. Yes, you are working on creating a bright future for them, but you can’t expect them to keep waiting around for one day to arrive. You need to schedule some time together with your Two at least once a week to keep them emotionally fulfilled.\r\n\r\nLuckily the Two is great with balancing, so if the two of you discuss how you’re going to arrange your work and playtime this can be a very fulfilling match for both of you.",
             "You probably fell in love with the Three at a party. You finally went out like your friends have been begging you to do for months. And then this gracious creature made you wonder why you waited so long to have fun.\r\n\r\nThe Three makes you feel like a million bucks. They know just what to say to make you smile. They lavish you with attention and stroke your ego whenever you’re together.\r\n\r\nBut their flirting feels a bit superficial. In some respects, you doubt the Three even lives in the real world… This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, and they can spice up your life in a big way. But if you like your life bland and predictable the Three is going to start working on your nerves soon. And they aren’t going to take well to the idea of switching parties now for practical goals like buying a house in five years…",
            "You and your Four have everything you need to build an empire together. You both like working towards goals and if you put your minds to it you’ll be able to create a life that gives you all the stability and comfort you both need.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this doesn’t leave a lot of room for romance. Fours aren’t naturally social and if the two of you don’t make an effort to spend time together and have fun you could burn yourselves out.\r\n\r\nYou both like structure and routine so creating little events throughout your week can help ensure that you stay connected. Maybe Wednesdays are pizza and movie nights; Saturdays can be date night at a nice restaurant… By adding little fun outings to your weekly schedule you’ll both be happier and more relaxed too. Which means you’ll have even more energy to fulfill your long-term goals.",
             "As a Four, you like knowing what’s going to happen next. But Fives are the most unpredictable creatures. Maybe you’ve been craving some excitement in your life lately, but don’t expect this to turn into a long-term relationship unless you’ve found a very atypical Five.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, you’re going to have a lot of fun with someone that has a Five Life Path. They’re going to take you places and show you things you never even thought of.\r\n\r\nBut for most Fours, Five energy can get extremely exhausting very quickly. If this happens don’t feel bad. You are used to investing your energy in long-term stability, while the Five likes investing their energy in memories rather than future hypotheticals. You could strike a happy compromise, but don’t be surprised if you part ways sooner than you thought you would. The Five probably has more exploring to do anyway and you need to get back to the real world.",
             "You’ve never seen someone manifest peace and prosperity so effortlessly. It feels like you’re constantly working. Then this person comes along that just effortlessly lives the lifestyle you’ve always dreamed of.\r\n\r\nBut the Six can be a little bit too relaxed for your liking. Sometimes they just spend a whole weekend doing nothing and that drives you nuts. Especially if you want to get something done. There’s a valuable lesson here for you though.\r\n\r\nThe Six has learned to trust in the Universe. They believe that no matter what, they’ll be okay. That’s why they can just switch off like that. You’re going to have to learn to do the same to stay sane. But if you do this can be a very stable and abundant relationship as your hard work and the Six’s ability to manifest work together to build a peaceful environment.",
             "You really value a solid argument and that’s exactly what the Seven brings to your life. They’ve thought of just about everything and when you go to them with a problem they can sort it out in seconds.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes they end up commenting on your plans even when you didn’t ask for their advice. And then when you go ahead and do things the way you planned the Seven gets a bit hot-headed.\r\n\r\nThis isn’t necessarily a bad thing. You just need to learn to show the Seven your whole plan and explain it. Sure, this might take a bit of time and a lot of patience as the Seven memorizes each step. But they will end up saving you a lot of trouble in the long run by pointing out inescapable flaws before you even knew they existed. This can free up some time for the two of you to spend time having fun together instead of just working all day long.",
            "The Eight seems to be everything you wish you could be. They get things done and they’re always doing it in a fair and balanced way. At least that’s what it seems like at first.\r\n\r\nBut once the Eight lets you into their decision-making process you realize that they have quite some trouble making up their minds. It’s as if they keep swinging back and forth between two extremes. You can help them to see the bigger picture and stay focused on the destination rather than the tiny details along the way though.\r\n\r\nThis is going to take quite some effort, but you’ll be rewarded with a relationship that’s filled with growth and development. Something you truly value. So the effort might just be worth it. Provided that your Eight is capable of letting things go from time to time that is.",
